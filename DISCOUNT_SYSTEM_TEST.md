# ✅ New Simplified Discount System - Test Guide

## **How It Works Now**

The discount system is now **completely simplified** and works exactly as you requested:

1. **Admin creates deals** with specific conditions (departure date, guest count, min spend, etc.)
2. **User selects deals** from home page or enters coupon codes
3. **At checkout**, system validates if booking meets deal requirements
4. **If conditions met** → Discount applied automatically
5. **If conditions NOT met** → Clear alert shows what's missing

### **Step 1: Create Deals (Admin)**

Go to `/admin` and create these test deals:

#### **Early Booking Deal**
- **Name**: "Early Bird Special"
- **Type**: "Early Booking (6 months advance)"  
- **Discount**: 30%
- **Days Before Departure**: 180
- **Valid dates**: Set current date to future

#### **Last Minute Deal**

- **Discount**: $500
- **Max Days Before Departure**: 30

- **Type**: "Group Booking (4+ guests)"
- **Discount**: 15%
- **Minimum Guests**: 4

#### **Coupon Code Deal**

### **Step 2: Test User Flow**

1. **Select a deal** on the home page (or skip this step for coupon codes)
2. **Book a cruise** - choose dates and guest count strategically
3. **Go to checkout** - deals are validated HERE
4. **Enter coupon codes** to test coupon validation
5. **See results**:
   - ✅ **Green alert**: "Deal applied! You saved $X"
   - ❌ **Red alert**: "Deal requirements not met: [specific reason]"

## **Test Scenarios**

### **✅ PASS Scenarios** (Should see green success)
- Early booking deal + cruise departing 200+ days from now
- Last minute deal + cruise departing within 25 days  
- Group deal + booking for 4+ guests
- Valid coupon code "SAVE20"
- Minimum spend deal + booking over $2000

### **❌ FAIL Scenarios** (Should see red alert with reason)
- Early booking deal + cruise departing in 90 days → "Early booking deal requires booking at least 180 days in advance. Current: 90 days"
- Group deal + booking for 2 guests → "Minimum 4 guests required. Current booking: 2 guests"
- Invalid coupon code → "Invalid coupon code"
- Minimum spend + $1500 booking → "Minimum booking amount of $2000 required. Current booking: $1500"

---

## **Key Features** ⭐

### **Clear Validation Messages**
The system now shows **exactly why** a deal doesn't apply:
- "Must book at least 180 days in advance. Current: 90 days until departure"
- "Minimum 4 guests required. Current booking: 2 guests"  
- "Minimum booking amount of $2000 required. Current: $1500"

### **Real-Time Validation**
- Deals are validated **at checkout time** using actual booking data
- Date calculations use **real departure dates**
- Guest count uses **actual selected guest count**
- Booking amount uses **real calculated total**

### **Simple Admin Interface**
- **5 deal types** with clear descriptions
- **Pre-filled defaults** (180 days, 4 guests, etc.)
