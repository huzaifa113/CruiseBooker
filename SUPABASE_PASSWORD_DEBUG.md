# Supabase Password Authentication Issue

## Current Problem
Password authentication is failing for the Supabase database connection.

## Possible Solutions

### 1. Verify Password in Supabase
- Go to your Supabase project settings
- Check if the password is exactly: `Lef086807`
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or characters

### 2. Reset Database Password (Recommended)
1. Go to **Settings â†’ Database** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Click **"Reset database password"**
3. Set a new simple password (like `password123`)
4. Use the new password in the connection string

### 3. URL Encoding
If your password has special characters, they need to be URL encoded:
- `@` becomes `%40`
- `#` becomes `%23`
- `&` becomes `%26`
- `+` becomes `%2B`

## What to Try
1. **Reset your database password** in Supabase to something simple like `password123`
2. **Get the new pooler connection string** with the new password
3. **Provide the complete new connection string**

The format will be:
```
postgresql://postgres.zxvbyqzenmyqndbeyjno:[NEW-PASSWORD]@aws-1-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```
